Hi there! 
VTSPendulum is a small plugin I made for Vtube Studio. It takes user input to create sine pendulum parameters inside VTS with specified range and speed. You can create a set of parameters with different settings and save/load configurations.

1. Download repo(you really only need /dist/VTSPendulum folder)
2. Open Vtube Studio
3. Open VTSPendulum.exe
4. Use AddParameter to add as many params as you want and name them.
5. Set range(min and max) and frequency. Press Start
6. Go to Vtube Studio and allow plugin to access API
7. Set your new parameter as input.
8.You're good.
